----------------------------- Calculator With History ----------------------------

--> What i am going to do ?
i will give directly giving an expression like (5+10)
it will also stores history like what previous expression is entered by the user

--> in history ?
1. show history
2. clear history
3. exit

--> what i am going to use here
1. input()
2. functions
3. conditional
4. file handling 
5. loops
6. basic math


------------------------------------------------    psedo code     ------------------------------------------------
1. start the program 
2. create one file (history.txt) to store history
3. start while loop:
    a. ask the user to enter a calculation (eg: - 8+5)
        or a command (history, clear, exit) 
   
    b. if user enter exit:
        -> print goodbye message
        -> break the loop
    
    c. if user enter history:
        -> try to open history file for reading 
        -> if file exists amd not empty , print each line (calculation)
        -> if file does not exists or empty , print "no history found"
        -> continue to the next loop

    d. if user enter clear
        -> open the history file and overwrite it with nothing(empty it)
        -> print history cleared
        -> continue to the next loop

    e.  other wise assume user entered a calculation:
        ->try to parse the input to get number and the operator 
          (you can split the input by space  eg "8 + 5")

        -> if input is not valid print "invalid input" continue

        -> perform the calculation using if/elif;
           if +, add
           if -, substrasct
           if *, multiply
           if /, division

        -> show the result to the user

        -> write the calculation and the result to the history file 

4. end the program
