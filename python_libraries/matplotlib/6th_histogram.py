# Histogram:-  A histogram is a type of bar chart that represents the distribution of numerical data by
                #  grouping values into ranges (bins) and displaying the frequency of occurrences in each range.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ages = [22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, 42, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75]
plt.hist(ages, bins=5, color="blue", edgecolor="black")

# what does bin means
# bins=5 â†’ Divides the age range into 5 groups (bins). 
'''
explanation:

X-axis (Age Groups): Divides ages into 5 bins (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, etc.).
Y-axis (Frequency): Shows how many people fall into each bin.
The tallest bar represents the most common age group.


Expected Output:

A histogram with 5 bars, each showing the frequency of people in that age range.
For example, if ages 22, 25, 28, and 30 fall into the same bin, that bar's height will be 4.
