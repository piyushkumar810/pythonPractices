----------------------- Issues in this file data:
CSV Formatting Issues:-
       --> The dataset you shared has missing values, which might cause errors when plotting.
       --> Thereâ€™s an extra empty row (NaN values at index 22), which could be causing issues.


Column Name Issues:-
        -->CSV files may have spaces in column names. Instead of df["Employee Salary"], 
            try df["Employee Salary"].astype(float) to ensure proper data type handling.

            
Missing Value Handling:-
        --> If Employee Salary has missing values (NaN), you need to handle them before plotting.
