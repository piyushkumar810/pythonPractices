'''
the Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of 
    different sizes which can slide onto any rod. 

The Problem:
-------------------------
You have three rods: usually named A (source), B (auxiliary), and C (destination).
You have n disks, each with a different size, and they are all initially stacked in decreasing size on rod A â€” the largest at the bottom, smallest at the top.
Your goal is to move the entire stack to rod C (destination), following three rules:

The Rules:
--------------------
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
