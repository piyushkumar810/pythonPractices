✅ QUESTION 1 (from PDF – Page 3)
❓ Question:

Insert one new product into the products collection with at least five fields.

🧠 Before Solving (Quick Setup Assumption)

We assume:

Database: storeDB

Collection: products

Fields we’ll use:

productId

productName

category

price

stock

✅ SOLUTION
use storeDB

db.products.insertOne({
  productId: 101,
  productName: "Wireless Mouse",
  category: "electronics",
  price: 1200,
  stock: 50
})

🧠 What this does (short & clear)

insertOne() → inserts one document

Document has 5 fields (as asked)

Stored inside products collection

✔ Question requirement satisfied

✅ Output (conceptually)
acknowledged: true
insertedId: ObjectId(...)

Great 👍
Let’s move to QUESTION 2, same pattern.

✅ QUESTION 2 (from CRUD practice)
❓ Question:

Insert multiple products into the products collection at once.

🧠 Assumptions (same as before)

Database: storeDB

Collection: products

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.insertMany([
  {
    productId: 102,
    productName: "Keyboard",
    category: "electronics",
    price: 1500,
    stock: 40
  },
  {
    productId: 103,
    productName: "Notebook",
    category: "stationery",
    price: 80,
    stock: 200
  },
  {
    productId: 104,
    productName: "Water Bottle",
    category: "accessories",
    price: 300,
    stock: 100
  }
])

🧠 What this does (simple)

insertMany() → inserts multiple documents

Each { } is one product

All documents go into products collection

✔ Question requirement satisfied

✅ Output (conceptually)
acknowledged: true
insertedIds: { 0: ObjectId(...), 1: ObjectId(...), 2: ObjectId(...) }

Perfect 👍
Let’s go to QUESTION 3, same clean flow.

✅ QUESTION 3 (CRUD – READ)
❓ Question:

Display all documents from the products collection.

🧠 What is being asked?

READ operation

Fetch all documents

No condition / filter

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find()

🧠 What this does (simple)

find() with no condition

Returns every document in products

This is the basic READ operation in MongoDB

✔ Question requirement satisfied

✅ Sample Output (example)
{ productId: 101, productName: "Wireless Mouse", ... }
{ productId: 102, productName: "Keyboard", ... }
{ productId: 103, productName: "Notebook", ... }

Q3. Insert a product that contains an embedded document
(details) and an array (ratings).

Nice 👍
Let’s solve Q3 cleanly and clearly.

✅ QUESTION 3
❓ Question:

Insert a product that contains an embedded document (details) and an array (ratings).

🧠 What is required?

One product document

An embedded document → details

An array → ratings

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.insertOne({
  productId: 105,
  productName: "Smart Watch",
  category: "electronics",
  price: 3500,
  details: {
    brand: "Noise",
    color: "Black",
    warranty: "1 Year"
  },
  ratings: [4, 5, 4, 5]
})

🧠 Explanation (short & clear)

details → embedded document

details: { brand, color, warranty }


ratings → array of values

ratings: [4, 5, 4, 5]


Entire data stored as one MongoDB document

✔ Embedded document + array requirement satisfied

✅ Concept check (exam point)

MongoDB supports nested documents

MongoDB supports arrays inside documents

When ready, say 👉 “Next question (Q4)”
We’ll continue 👍

Q4. Create a database storeDB and switch to it.
Q5. Create a collection named products. Insert any sample
document of your choice.

Perfect 👍
Let’s do Q4 and Q5 step by step, short and clear, exactly how you should write/practice.

✅ Q4. Create a database storeDB and switch to it
🧠 What is asked?

Create a database named storeDB

Switch to it

✅ SOLUTION
use storeDB

🧠 Explanation (simple)

use storeDB

If the database does not exist, MongoDB creates it automatically

If it exists, MongoDB switches to it

✔ Database created and switched

✅ Q5. Create a collection named products and insert any sample document
🧠 What is asked?

Create collection: products

Insert one sample document

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.insertOne({
  productId: 201,
  productName: "Pen",
  category: "stationery",
  price: 20,
  stock: 500
})

🧠 Explanation (simple)

products → collection name

insertOne() → creates the collection automatically

One document inserted with sample fields

✔ Collection created
✔ Sample document inserted

📝 EXAM NOTE (IMPORTANT)

In MongoDB:

Collections are created automatically on first insert

No explicit CREATE TABLE command like SQL

Q6. Retrieve all products from the collection.
Q7. Display only productName and price for all products.
Q8. Retrieve only products whose price is greater than 1000

Perfect 👍
Let’s solve Q6, Q7, and Q8 one by one, clean, exam-style, with short explanations.

✅ Q6. Retrieve all products from the collection
🧠 What is asked?

READ operation

Fetch all documents

No condition

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find()

🧠 Explanation

find() without any condition returns all documents

Shows every field of every product

✔ Requirement satisfied

✅ Q7. Display only productName and price for all products
🧠 What is asked?

Projection

Show only selected fields

Hide others

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find(
  {},
  { productName: 1, price: 1, _id: 0 }
)

🧠 Explanation

{} → no filter (all documents)

productName: 1 → include

price: 1 → include

_id: 0 → exclude MongoDB’s default _id

✔ Only required fields displayed

✅ Q8. Retrieve only products whose price is greater than 1000
🧠 What is asked?

Conditional READ

Use comparison operator

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 1000 } })

🧠 Explanation

$gt → greater than

Returns products where price > 1000

✔ Condition applied correctly

📝 QUICK EXAM MEMORY 🔐
find()                     → all documents
find({}, {field:1})        → projection
$gt, $lt, $gte, $lte       → comparison operators

Query Filters
Q9. Retrieve products that belong to the category
"electronics".
Q10. Retrieve products whose brand under details.brand is
"LogiTech".

Perfect 👍
Let’s solve Q9 and Q10 cleanly, step by step, with simple explanations (no extra theory).

✅ Q9. Retrieve products that belong to the category "electronics"
🧠 What is asked?

Filter documents by a field value

Field: category

✅ Q10. Retrieve products whose brand under details.brand is "LogiTech"
🧠 What is asked?

Filter using a nested (embedded) field

Field path: details.brand

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find({ "details.brand": "LogiTech" })

🧠 Explanation (short)

"details.brand" → dot notation

Used to access fields inside an embedded document

Returns products where brand is LogiTech

✔ Nested filter applied correctly

📝 QUICK EXAM MEMORY 🔐
Simple field filter      → { field: value }
Nested field filter      → { "parent.child": value }

Field Updates
Q11. Update the price of any product by increasing it by 200.
Q12. Add a new field discount to a selected product.
Q13. Change the value of an existing field (example: update the
brand name).

Perfect 👍
Let’s solve Q11, Q12, Q13 one by one, clear, exam-style, with short explanations.

✅ Q11. Update the price of any product by increasing it by 200
🧠 What is asked?

Update operation

Increase existing value

Use increment operator

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Keyboard" },
  { $inc: { price: 200 } }
)

🧠 Explanation (simple)

$inc → increases numeric value

price: 200 → adds 200 to existing price

updateOne() → updates only one matching document

✔ Price increased successfully

✅ Q12. Add a new field discount to a selected product
🧠 What is asked?

Add a new field

Field does not exist earlier

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Keyboard" },
  { $set: { discount: 10 } }
)

🧠 Explanation

$set:

Adds field if it does not exist

Updates field if it already exists

discount: 10 → new field added

✔ New field added successfully

✅ Q13. Change the value of an existing field
(Example: update the brand name)
🧠 What is asked?

Modify an existing field

Field inside an embedded document

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Smart Watch" },
  { $set: { "details.brand": "LogiTech" } }
)

🧠 Explanation

"details.brand" → dot notation for embedded field

$set → updates existing value

✔ Brand name updated successfully

📝 QUICK EXAM MEMORY 🔐
$inc → increase/decrease number
$set → add or update field
updateOne → updates first matching document

Array Updates
Q14. Add a rating to the ratings array of a specific product.
Q15. Remove the last rating from the ratings array.

Perfect 👍
Let’s solve Q14 and Q15 clearly, exam-style, step by step.

✅ Q14. Add a rating to the ratings array of a specific product
🧠 What is asked?

Update an array field

Add one new value to the array

Use array update operator

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Smart Watch" },
  { $push: { ratings: 5 } }
)

🧠 Explanation (simple)

$push → adds a new element to an array

ratings: 5 → value added at the end of the array

Works only on array fields

✔ Rating added successfully

✅ Q15. Remove the last rating from the ratings array
🧠 What is asked?

Remove an element from an array

Specifically the last element

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Smart Watch" },
  { $pop: { ratings: 1 } }
)

🧠 Explanation (simple)

$pop: 1 → removes last element

$pop: -1 → removes first element

Used only for arrays

✔ Last rating removed successfully

📝 QUICK EXAM MEMORY 🔐
$push → add element to array
$pop: 1 → remove last element
$pop: -1 → remove first element

is another way except push and pop
answer in sort

Yes 👍 there ARE other ways, apart from $push and $pop.

Short & exam-oriented answer 👇
🔹 Add element to array (other than $push)
$addToSet


👉 Adds value only if it does not already exist (no duplicates).

Example:

db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Smart Watch" },
  { $addToSet: { ratings: 5 } }
)

🔹 Remove element from array (other than $pop)
$pull


👉 Removes specific value from array.

Example:

db.products.updateOne(
  { productName: "Smart Watch" },
  { $pull: { ratings: 4 } }
)

🧠 Quick comparison (memory lock)
$push      → add element (allows duplicates)
$addToSet  → add element (no duplicates)
$pop       → remove first / last element
$pull      → remove specific value

Q18. Delete all products whose price is less than 200.
▶ Mixed Practice
Q19. Insert a new product, update one field, add a rating, then
delete that product.
Q20. Retrieve products using at least two filter conditions
(example: price > 500 and category = ”audio”).

Perfect 👍
Let’s solve Q16–Q20 step by step, clean, exam-style, with short explanations.

✅ Q16. Delete one product using its productId
🧠 What is asked?

Delete operation

Only one document

Condition: productId

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.deleteOne({ productId: 201 })

🧠 Explanation

deleteOne() → deletes first matching document

Filter based on productId

✔ One product deleted

✅ Q17. Delete all products that belong to a specific category
🧠 What is asked?

Delete multiple documents

Condition: category

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.deleteMany({ category: "stationery" })

🧠 Explanation

deleteMany() → deletes all matching documents

Removes all stationery products

✔ Multiple products deleted

✅ Q18. Delete all products whose price is less than 200
🧠 What is asked?

Conditional delete

Use comparison operator

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.deleteMany({ price: { $lt: 200 } })

🧠 Explanation

$lt → less than

Deletes all products with price < 200

✔ Condition applied correctly

▶️ MIXED PRACTICE
✅ Q19. Insert a new product → update one field → add a rating → delete that product
🔹 Step 1: Insert product
db.products.insertOne({
  productId: 301,
  productName: "Headphones",
  category: "audio",
  price: 800,
  ratings: []
})

🔹 Step 2: Update one field (price)
db.products.updateOne(
  { productId: 301 },
  { $set: { price: 900 } }
)

🔹 Step 3: Add a rating
db.products.updateOne(
  { productId: 301 },
  { $push: { ratings: 4 } }
)

🔹 Step 4: Delete the product
db.products.deleteOne({ productId: 301 })


✔ Full CRUD cycle completed

✅ Q20. Retrieve products using two filter conditions

(price > 500 AND category = "audio")

🧠 What is asked?

Multiple conditions

AND operation (default in MongoDB)

✅ SOLUTION
db.products.find({
  price: { $gt: 500 },
  category: "audio"
})

🧠 Explanation

MongoDB applies AND by default

Both conditions must be true

✔ Correct multi-condition filter

🧠 QUICK EXAM MEMORY 🔐
deleteOne()  → delete single document
deleteMany() → delete multiple documents
$lt / $gt    → comparison filters
Multiple conditions → AND by default

Tricky delete/update cases

Short exam answers

Just say 👍

db.products.find({
  price: { $gt: 500 },
  category: "audio"
})


for above query is this correct
db.products.find({
$and:[
{price:{$gt:500}},
{category:"audio"}
]
})

✅ Yes — your query is 100% CORRECT.

Both queries are logically equivalent in MongoDB 👍
They will return the same result.

🔹 Query 1 (Implicit AND — most common)
db.products.find({
  price: { $gt: 500 },
  category: "audio"
})


✔ MongoDB applies AND by default when you list multiple conditions.

🔹 Query 2 (Explicit AND — also correct)
db.products.find({
  $and: [
    { price: { $gt: 500 } },
    { category: "audio" }
  ]
})


✔ $and explicitly combines conditions.

🧠 IMPORTANT EXAM RULE 🔐
Multiple conditions in find() = AND by default
$and is optional in simple cases

❓ When should you USE $and?

You need $and when:

You use multiple conditions on the SAME field

Example:

db.products.find({
  $and: [
    { price: { $gt: 500 } },
    { price: { $lt: 2000 } }
  ]
})

❌ This would be WRONG without $and:
// ❌ WRONG
db.products.find({
  price: { $gt: 500 },
  price: { $lt: 2000 }
})


(Second price overwrites the first)
