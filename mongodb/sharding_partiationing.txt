🧠 MCQs: MongoDB Sharding & Partitioning
🔹 MCQ 1 (Medium – Core Idea)

What is the primary problem that sharding solves?

A. Data inconsistency
B. Schema rigidity
C. Single server resource limits
D. Lack of indexing

✅ Answer: C
🧠 One server cannot grow forever (CPU, RAM, disk, network limits). 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 2 (Medium)

Which statement BEST differentiates partitioning from sharding?

A. Partitioning duplicates data, sharding does not
B. Partitioning splits data; sharding distributes it across machines
C. Sharding is vertical scaling
D. Partitioning requires replica sets

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Partitioning splits data; sharding distributes partitions across machines. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 3 (Medium)

Which scaling approach does sharding represent?

A. Vertical scaling (scale-up)
B. Horizontal scaling (scale-out)
C. Diagonal scaling
D. In-memory scaling

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Sharding is MongoDB’s main scale-out (horizontal) strategy. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 4 (Medium – Symptoms)

Which symptom indicates the need for sharding?

A. Low disk usage
B. Index fits entirely in RAM
C. Writes slow due to disk saturation
D. Small collection size

✅ Answer: C
🧠 Slow writes due to disk/lock contention signal sharding need. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 5 (Medium – Key Terms)

In MongoDB sharding, a shard is:

A. A query router
B. A metadata store
C. A node (or replica set) storing a subset of data
D. A chunk of documents

✅ Answer: C
🧠 Shard stores a subset of application data. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 6 (Medium)

What is a chunk in MongoDB sharding?

A. A replica of data
B. A contiguous range of shard key values
C. A full collection
D. A database snapshot

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Data is split into chunks based on shard key ranges. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 7 (Medium – Architecture)

Which component routes queries to the correct shard(s)?

A. Shard server
B. Config server
C. mongod
D. mongos

✅ Answer: D
🧠 Applications connect to mongos, the query router. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 8 (Medium)

What do config servers store?

A. Application data
B. Query results
C. Cluster metadata and chunk information
D. User credentials only

✅ Answer: C
🧠 Config servers store metadata about the cluster and chunks. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 9 (Hard – Shard Key)

Which statement about a shard key is TRUE?

A. It duplicates data across shards
B. It decides which shard stores a document
C. It is optional in sharded clusters
D. It improves indexing only

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Shard key determines data distribution and query targeting. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 10 (Hard – Properties)

Which shard key property helps even data distribution?

A. Low cardinality
B. High cardinality
C. Fixed values
D. Boolean values

✅ Answer: B
🧠 High cardinality (many distinct values) distributes load better. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 11 (Hard – Query Routing)

Queries that do not include the shard key result in:

A. Targeted queries
B. Indexed reads only
C. Broadcast (scatter-gather) queries
D. Single-shard execution

✅ Answer: C
🧠 mongos must query many shards and merge results. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 12 (Hard – Hotspots)

What is hotspotting?

A. Even distribution of writes
B. Many writes concentrated on one shard
C. Balanced chunk movement
D. Fast read performance

✅ Answer: B
🧠 A small shard key range receives most writes, overloading one shard. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 13 (Advanced – Partitioning Strategy)

Which strategy is BEST for range queries (e.g., date ranges)?

A. Hashed partitioning
B. Random partitioning
C. Range-based partitioning
D. Key-value partitioning

✅ Answer: C
🧠 Range partitioning groups documents by shard key ranges. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 14 (Advanced)

Which partitioning strategy gives even write distribution but hurts range queries?

A. Range-based
B. Hashed
C. Vertical
D. Manual

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Hashed keys distribute writes evenly; range targeting is harder. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 15 (Advanced – Balancing)

What is the purpose of balancing in a sharded cluster?

A. Duplicate data for fault tolerance
B. Evenly distribute chunks across shards
C. Speed up indexing
D. Reduce network latency

✅ Answer: B
🧠 Balancing prevents hot shards and storage skew. 

sharding

🔹 MCQ 16 (Advanced – Exam Trap)

Which shard key choice is NOT recommended?

A. orderId
B. userId
C. timestamp (sequential)
D. high-cardinality UUID

✅ Answer: C
🧠 Sequential keys can create write hotspots. 

sharding

🧠 FINAL MEMORY LOCK 🔐
Sharding → horizontal scaling
Shard key → decides data placement
Chunks → ranges of shard key values
mongos → query router
Broadcast query → no shard key in query
Hashed → even writes
Range → good for range queries
