🔹 MCQ 2 (Basic)

Which principle allows replicas to temporarily hold different versions of data?

A. Atomicity
B. Consistency
C. Soft-state
D. Durability

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Soft-state means data may be temporarily inconsistent 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 3 (Medium)

Which of the following best describes Eventual Consistency?

A. Data is always consistent
B. Data never becomes consistent
C. Data becomes consistent after some time
D. Data is rolled back

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Eventual consistency ensures replicas converge over time

🔹 MCQ 4 (Medium)

Why did BASE principles emerge?

A. To replace SQL completely
B. ACID is inefficient for small databases
C. ACID is restrictive in distributed systems

🔹 MCQ 6 (Medium – ACID vs BASE)

Which of the following is TRUE?

A. BASE guarantees immediate consistency
B. ACID prioritizes availability
C. BASE prioritizes availability and performance
D. ACID is used in distributed web systems

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:

🔹 MCQ 7 (CAP Theorem – Core)

According to CAP Theorem, a distributed system can guarantee at most:

A. All three properties
B. Only one property
C. Any two properties
D. Only consistency

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
CAP theorem states only two out of C, A, P can be guaranteed 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 8 (Medium)

What does Partition Tolerance (P) mean?

A. Data is always consistent
B. System works despite network failures
C. Requests are never rejected
D. Database runs on one node

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
Partition tolerance means system continues despite message loss or network splits 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 9 (Medium – Mapping)

Which CAP properties do most NoSQL databases prioritize?

A. C + A
B. C + P
C. A + P
D. C only

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
NoSQL systems usually choose Availability + Partition tolerance 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 10 (Medium – RDBMS)

Which CAP properties do traditional RDBMS focus on?

A. A + P
B. C + P
C. A + C
D. P only

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
RDBMS prioritize Consistency + Partition tolerance 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 11 (Hard – Concept Trap)

Which statement is CORRECT?

A. CAP theorem applies only to NoSQL
B. Network partitions are avoidable
C. No system can guarantee C, A, and P simultaneously
D. RDBMS always choose A + P

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
In real systems, network partitions are unavoidable 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 12 (RDBMS vs NoSQL)

Which feature is characteristic of RDBMS?

A. Flexible schema
B. Horizontal scaling
C. Strong ACID guarantees
D. Schema-less design

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
RDBMS provide strong ACID guarantees 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 13 (NoSQL 특징)

Which feature is characteristic of NoSQL databases?

A. Fixed schema
B. Vertical scaling
C. Flexible schema
D. Strong joins

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
NoSQL databases use schema-flexible documents 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 14 (Scaling – Exam Favorite)

Which scaling approach is used by NoSQL systems?

A. Scale-up
B. Scale-down
C. Horizontal scaling
D. Single-node optimization

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
NoSQL systems scale horizontally across clusters 

base_principle

🔹 MCQ 15 (Hard – Application based)

Which application BEST fits RDBMS usage?

A. Social media feed
B. IoT sensor data
C. Banking transactions
D. Real-time chat app

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Banking needs strong consistency and ACID 

base_principle

🧠 FINAL MEMORY LOCK 🔐
BASE → Availability over consistency
Soft-state → Temporary inconsistency
Eventual consistency → Converges later

CAP → Only 2 of C, A, P
NoSQL → A + P
RDBMS → C + P
