🔹 MCQ 3 (Medium)

Which schema design stores related data inside the same document?

A. Normalized schema
B. Referenced schema
C. Embedded schema
D. Relational schema

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:

🔹 MCQ 4 (Medium)

Embedded schema is MOST suitable when:

A. Relationship is many-to-many
B. Data grows without bound
C. Related data is always accessed together
D. Data is reused across collections

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Embedding is ideal when data is read together most of the time

🔹 MCQ 5 (Medium–Hard)

Which of the following is a disadvantage of embedded schema?

A. Poor read performance
B. Increased round-trips
C. Data duplication
D. Complex queries

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Embedded design can cause data duplication if the same data is repeated many times

🔹 MCQ 6 (Hard – Application based)

A product can have thousands of reviews, and reviews grow continuously.
Which schema design is BEST?

A. Embedded
B. Referenced
C. Hybrid only
D. Flat document

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
When data grows without bound, referencing is recommended

🔹 MCQ 7 (Hard)

Which schema design stores related data in separate collections linked by identifiers?

A. Embedded
B. Denormalized
C. Referenced
D. Hierarchical

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Referenced schema keeps related entities in separate collections

🔹 MCQ 8 (Hard – Cardinality)

According to MongoDB schema design rules, many-to-many relationships should be:

A. Embedded
B. Ignored
C. Referenced
D. Flattened

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Many-to-many relationships should always use referencing

🔹 MCQ 9 (Hard – Performance)

Which schema design provides the fastest read performance?

A. Referenced schema
B. Embedded schema
C. Relational schema
D. Normalized schema

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
Embedded schema gives single-document reads, which are fastest

🔹 MCQ 10 (Hard – Document Size)

MongoDB documents have a maximum size limit of:

A. 8 MB
B. 10 MB
C. 16 MB
D. 32 MB

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
MongoDB enforces a 16 MB document size limit, influencing schema decisions

🔹 MCQ 11 (Advanced – Update Frequency)

Which rule is CORRECT regarding update frequency?

A. Frequently updated fields should be embedded
B. Rarely updated fields should be referenced
C. Frequently updated fields should be referenced
D. Update frequency does not affect schema design

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Frequently updated fields → reference to avoid rewriting large documents

🔹 MCQ 12 (Advanced – Real scenario)

A customer is shared across hundreds of orders and must be updated centrally.
Which schema design is BEST?

A. Embedded
B. Referenced
C. Key-value

🔹 MCQ 13 (Advanced – Comparison trap)

Which statement is TRUE?

A. Embedded schema avoids duplication
B. Referenced schema requires joins at DB level
C. Embedded schema reduces number of queries
D. Referenced schema gives fastest reads

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Embedded schema minimizes queries by keeping all data in one document

.

🔹 MCQ 14 (Advanced – Query pattern)

MongoDB schema design should primarily be based on:

A. Data normalization rules
B. Storage optimization
C. Application query patterns
D. Foreign key relationships

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
MongoDB schemas are designed around how data is queried, not strict normalization

🔹 MCQ 15 (Very Important – Exam Favorite)

Which of the following is FALSE?

A. Embedded schema is good for one-to-few relationships
B. Referenced schema avoids duplication
C. Embedded schema is ideal for unlimited growth
D. Referenced schema supports shared data

❌ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
Embedded schema is NOT suitable for unlimited growth

🧠 FINAL MEMORY LOCK 🔐
Embed → Read together, one-to-few, fast reads
Reference → Large growth, shared data, many-to-many
Schema design → Based on query patterns
Document size limit → 16 MB
