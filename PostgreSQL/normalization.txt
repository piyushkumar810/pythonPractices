🧠 MCQs: NORMALIZATION (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
🔹 MCQ 1 (Basic)
Which of the following violates 1NF?

A. Atomic attributes
B. Repeating groups
C. Composite primary key
D. Functional dependency

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
1NF requires atomic (single) values. Repeating groups violate 1NF.

🔹 MCQ 2 (Basic)
A table with attributes (StudentID, PhoneNumbers) where PhoneNumbers contains multiple values violates:

A. 1NF
B. 2NF
C. 3NF
D. BCNF

✅ Answer: A

🧠 Explanation:
Multi-valued attributes violate 1NF.

🔹 MCQ 3 (Medium)
In a relation with composite primary key (A, B), which dependency causes a 2NF violation?

A. (A, B) → C
B. A → B
C. A → C
D. C → D

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
If a non-key attribute (C) depends on part of a composite key (A) → partial dependency → violates 2NF.

🔹 MCQ 4 (Medium)
Which of the following is TRUE about 2NF?

A. It removes transitive dependency
B. It removes multivalued dependency
C. It removes partial dependency
D. It guarantees BCNF

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
2NF focuses on partial dependencies, not transitive ones.

🔹 MCQ 5 (Medium)
If a relation has a single-attribute primary key, then:

A. It cannot be in 2NF
B. It automatically satisfies 2NF
C. It violates 1NF
D. It must be decomposed

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
Partial dependency is possible only with composite keys.

🔹 MCQ 6 (Medium–Hard)
Given the dependency chain:

A → B
B → C


Which dependency causes 3NF violation?

A. A → B
B. B → C
C. A → C
D. A → B and B → C

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
A non-key attribute (B) determining another non-key attribute (C) causes transitive dependency.

🔹 MCQ 7 (Hard)

Which of the following conditions MUST be true for a relation to be in 3NF?

A. Every determinant is a super key
B. No partial dependency exists
C. No transitive dependency exists
D. Only single-attribute keys exist

✅ Answer: C

🧠 Explanation:
3NF eliminates transitive dependencies.

🔹 MCQ 8 (Hard – Key Concept)

Which of the following best defines a candidate key?

A. Any attribute in the relation
B. A minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies tuples
C. A super key with redundant attributes
D. A foreign key

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
Candidate key = minimal super key.

🔹 MCQ 9 (Hard – Based on Your Question)

For the relation
R(A, B, C, D)
with FDs:

A → B
B → C
A → D


What is the highest normal form satisfied?

A. 1NF
B. 2NF
C. 3NF
D. BCNF

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
There is a transitive dependency: A → B → C, so 3NF is violated.

🔹 MCQ 10 (Hard – Concept Trap)

Which of the following anomalies is caused by transitive dependency?

A. Insertion anomaly
B. Update anomaly
C. Deletion anomaly
D. All of the above

✅ Answer: D

🧠 Explanation:
Transitive dependency causes redundancy, leading to all three anomalies.

🔹 MCQ 11 (Hard)

Which normal form is specifically designed to remove multivalued dependencies?

A. 3NF
B. BCNF
C. 4NF
D. 5NF

✅ Answer: C

🔹 MCQ 12 (Hard – Exam Favorite)

Which statement is CORRECT?

A. BCNF is always dependency preserving
B. 3NF may allow some redundancy
C. 2NF removes transitive dependency
D. 1NF removes partial dependency

✅ Answer: B

🧠 Explanation:
3NF allows some redundancy to preserve dependencies.

🧠 QUICK MEMORY LOCK 🔐
1NF → Atomic values
2NF → No partial dependency
3NF → No transitive dependency
Candidate key → Minimal identifier
