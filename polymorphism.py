# ----------------------polymorphism in python

# polymorphism means that different object can be treated as if they are of same type, allowing them
# to respond to the same method or function in their own way


# eg

print(1+2)
print("1" + "2")
# see here, you know in pyhton everything is object in this example bith place i am using + operator
# but woorking of both line is different
print("\n")

# eg2
list1=[4,"piyush",4.5, True]
print(list1)
print(type(list1))
print("\n")

dict1={
    1:"piyush",
    2:"kumar",
    3:"raj",
    4:"rohit"
}
print(dict1)
print(type(dict1))
print("\n")
