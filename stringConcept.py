# ---------------------------------------------concept of string

print('anything that enclosed between single and double quote is considered as string')
# eg 1
name="piyush kr"
print('hello', name)

# name1="he said, "i want to eat apple""
# here pyphton will confuse which double quote is used were to solve this you can use either scape sequence or single quote
name2='he said, "i want to eat apple"'
name3="he said, \"i want to eat apple\""
print(name2)
print(name3)

# ---------------------------------------how to use multiline string

# eg 2
cow=""" cow is a animal
    he has four legs , two ears and one tail
