'''
Feature	                    Module	                                          Package
--------              -----------------------                        ----------------------------
What is it?	          A single Python file (.py)	                 A folder containing multiple modules
Purpose	              Stores related functions & classes	         Groups related modules together
Example	              math.py	                                     numpy, pandas (which have many modules inside)
Import	              import module_name	                         from package_name import module_name

real life example :
Think of modules as books ðŸ“– and packages as a library ðŸ“š.

A module (math.py) is one book with formulas.
A package (numpy) is a library with multiple books (modules) on mathematics.
