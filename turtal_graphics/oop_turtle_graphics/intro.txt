using oop in turtle graphics:-
 
why we need this approach ?
--> there is only one arrow,turtle on the screen but what if you need to use 2,3,4...n turtles then here,
    we will create turtle objects 
    for creating turtle object we need a class and here class is "Turtle" t=captial.
    that why we need object oriented approach
