-------------------⚡ Speed Comparison: Python API vs .NET API

🥇 Winner: .NET (C#)
.NET is generally faster than Python for building APIs — sometimes 3x to 20x faster.


🧠 Why .NET is Faster?
✔ Compiled Language

    C# is compiled to machine code 
    Runs on extremely optimized .NET runtime
    Python is interpreted → slower execution

✔ Better Multithreading
    .NET handles threads and async I/O more efficiently
    Python has GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) → limits CPU performance

✔ High-Performance Libraries
    ASP.NET Core is one of the fastest web frameworks in the world
    Beats Flask, Django, Node.js in benchmarks

(Approximate values)

Framework	             Speed
ASP.NET Core	        ⭐ 7,00,000+ RPS
FastAPI (Python)	     ~1,00,000 RPS
Flask (Python)	         ~20,000 RPS

🔹 .NET is 7–10 times faster than FastAPI
🔹 .NET is 20–30 times faster than Flask
