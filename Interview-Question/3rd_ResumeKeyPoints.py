Use a clear format with project title, organization name, and date.
Mention technologies used and a short description.

# 7. Keep it Error-Free & Professional
'''
Use proper grammar and spelling.
Avoid unnecessary details; focus on relevant skills and achievements.
Keep the resume one page (for freshers) or two pages max (for experienced professionals).
'''



# -------------------------------Types of skill
'''
Skill Types:
âœ… Soft Skills --> Personal attributes that help in workplace interactions (e.g., communication, leadership, adaptability).
âœ… Hard Skills --> Technical or job-specific abilities (e.g., Python programming, data analysis, Excel proficiency).

Since problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking relate to how you interact, think, and work in a team, 
they fall under soft skills. However, they are highly valued in technical roles as well! ðŸš€

# ---------------------------------- difference between  personal profile and summery
'''
personal profile:-
A personal profile is a brief introduction highlighting your skills, experience, and career goals. 
It gives employers a quick idea of who you are.

Summery:-
A summary (sometimes called a professional summary) serves a similar purpose but is often more 
achievement-focused and used for experienced professionals.
