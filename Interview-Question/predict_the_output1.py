l1=[20,30,40]
l2=5
print(l1*l2)

# explanation
'''
In Python, multiplying a list by an integer (like l1 * l2) creates a new list where the original list 
(l1) is repeated l2 times.

Pythonâ€™s * operator for lists is overloaded to perform repetition.
l1 * l2 means "repeat the list l1 exactly l2 times."

-----------output
[20, 30, 40, 20, 30, 40, 20, 30, 40, 20, 30, 40, 20, 30, 40]
