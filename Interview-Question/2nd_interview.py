# Q1) what is pyhton?
'''ans -> python is a versitile and high level programmig language which is known for its simplicity and 
         redability. it is widely used in various domain llike web- development , app devlopment
         data analsis, artifical intiligence and so on: 
          it is easy to use.
          interpreted language.
          dynamic typed - means we don't need to declear variable explicitly.
          oop feature.
          extensive libraries.'''

# Q2) difference between map and filter?
''' ans -> map -> the map() function is used to apply a specific function to every item in an iterable 
                  (like a list, tuple, or set) and return a map object (an iterator).
                  
                  the function applied to all elements must return a value.
                  
                  here output size is same as the input size.
                  
        filter -> The filter() function in Python is used to filter elements from an iterable based on 
                  a condition specified by a function.
                  
                  the function must return a boolean (True or False).
                  
                  here output size may decreases because of filitration.'''

# Q3) what are loop control statement in python?
''' ans -> the loop control statement in python alloow you to alter the normal flow of a loop.
           there are 3 types of loop control statement in pyhton.
           
           1st -> break statement (exit form the loop permenently if condition met.)
           2nd -> continue statement(skips the current intration and goes to the next iteration.)
           3rd -> pass statement (it does nothing and allows the code to continue running)'''
