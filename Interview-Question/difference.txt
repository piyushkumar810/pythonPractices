what is the difference between (math, random, string)these types of library and (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)these libraries

🐍 1. Core Python Modules (math, random, string)
These are built-in libraries — they come automatically with Python.

📊 2. External Python Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
These are third-party libraries — you must install them using:

| Feature        | **math/random/string** | **NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib** |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Type           | Built-in               | External (need to install)  |
| Data scale     | Small, simple          | Large, complex              |
| Use case       | Basic programming      | Data science / analysis     |
| Data structure | Numbers, strings       | Arrays, DataFrames          |
| Visualization  | ❌ Not supported       | ✅ Yes (Matplotlib)        |
| Performance    | Slower for big data    | Faster (C-optimized)        |



what is the difference betweeen library, package and Modules

| Term        | What it is                             | Example                         | Analogy                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Module**  | A single `.py` file with code          | `math.py`, `random.py`          | A single book                      |
| **Package** | A folder of modules with `__init__.py` | `numpy/core/`                   | A bookshelf with related books     |
| **Library** | A collection of packages/modules       | `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` | A library building full of shelves |
