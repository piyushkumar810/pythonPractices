# -----------------------------problem


# 1) Write a program to calculate and display the payroll for employees based on hours worked and hourly wage. [ODD]
# Requirements:

# i. Use a struct to store each Employee's details: name, employeeID, hoursWorked, and hourlyWage.

# ii. Calculate the total pay for each employee (total pay = hoursWorked * hourlyWage).

# iii. Use a function calculatePay() to calculate and return the pay.

# iv. Display a summary report listing each employeeâ€™s name, hours worked, and total pay.

# v. Use loops and conditionals for processing multiple employees.
