# -----------------------polymorphism can be implemented by four ways

# 1st --> duck typing
# 2nd --> method overloading
# 3rd --> operator overloading
# 4th --> method overriding

# 1st ------------------ duck typing

# in python duck typing feature used because it allowed the data type to be dynamic

    def quack(self):
        return "quake !"
    
class cat:
